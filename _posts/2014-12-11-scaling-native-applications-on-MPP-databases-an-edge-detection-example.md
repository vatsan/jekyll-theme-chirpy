My colleague [Gautam Muralidhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautamsmuralidhar) and I describe how we can leverage native C/C++ applications on Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) databases like Greenplum using procedural languages such as PL/C or PL/Python on Greenplum. We illustrate an example using the Canny's Edge Detection algorithm commonly used in image processing.
