My colleague from EMC, [John Cardente](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcardente) and I presented our work on how a climate data lake could empower citizen scientists studying climate change in Acadia National park. This Strata + Hadoop World 2015 talk was based on the week we spent in Acadia National Park in November 2014 which I had previously blogged about in [From Sea to Trees, Pivotal Data Science Looks at Climate Change in Acadia National Park](https://vatsan.github.io/posts/from-sea-to-trees-pivotal-data-science-looks-at-climate-change-in-acadia-national-park/).
