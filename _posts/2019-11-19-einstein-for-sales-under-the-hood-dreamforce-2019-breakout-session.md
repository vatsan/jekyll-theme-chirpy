## Einstein for Sales: Under the Hood (Dreamforce 2019 Breakout Session)

We got a chance to allow our customers to peek under the hood of the machine learning pipelines powering a variety of features in [Sales Cloud Einstein]() and [Pardot Einstein](). While this is the 4th time I am attending Dreamforce, it was the first time as a presenter. I had great fun co-presenting our work with [Bonnie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnie-parisi-formerly-gold-0464032) and [Yoel](https://il.linkedin.com/in/yamir), our product leaders in Einstein. We started off with a Kahoot quiz on little factoids about Sales Cloud Einstein where the winners walked away with Amazon Echo Dots, followed by a whirlwind tour by Bonnie/Yoel on the capabilities of Sales Cloud Einstein, followed by a technical deepdive on the machine learning pipelines powering our scores and insights by me and finally a panel with [Elad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eladdonsky/), our VP of Engineering and [Anna](https://il.linkedin.com/in/anna-reznikov-6a339799) our lead engineering from the team that brings you Opportunity Scoring.
