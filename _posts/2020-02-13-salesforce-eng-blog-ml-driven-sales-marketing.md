We will describe our modeling approaches and share our journey on interpretable models to earn the trust of our customers by providing actionable insights with our predictions. Additionally, we will also describe how we generate scores and insights for all customers through a model tournament, so that enterprises and small businesses alike can benefit from our machine learning products. Finally, we will give you a glimpse into the architecture that powers these predictions for our customers and our monitoring pipelines to ensure our models are performant in production.
