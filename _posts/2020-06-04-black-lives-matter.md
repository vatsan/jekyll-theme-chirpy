As I see many of the peaceful #BLM protests being met with violence at the hands of law enforcement, I am reminded of [Gandhi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/), 
the oscar winning 1982 film by Richard Attenborough that introduced the great Ben Kingsley as the titular character. 
There is a scene in that movie where hundreds of peaceful protestors at the [Salt March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March) 
(a show of non-violent, civil disobedience) led by Mahatma Gandhi are violently beaten up by the British. 
Martin Sheen's character, a journalist, makes a phone call to his editors, saying,

> "Whatever moral ascendancy the West once held was lost here today. India is free, for she has taken all that steel and 
cruelty can give, and she has neither cringed nor retreated."

This is what's going on today, sadly. I am going to go re-watch that movie, hoping that the winds of change shall 
blow soon and that justice is served.

If you are interested, here's a link to the trailer:
