I co-wrote a blog on how we operationalize data science models on the Pivotal stack by leveraging in-database scalable methods for model training and stream processing functions in Apache Geode for model scoring. This was joint work with my colleagues [Regunathan Radhakrishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regu-radhakrishnan-4b76bb1), [Jin Yu](https://au.linkedin.com/in/jin-yu-24412838), [Kaushik Das](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadas) ). The blog was published in the Pivotal Engineering Journal, you can read it below.
