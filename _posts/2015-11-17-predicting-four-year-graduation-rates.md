My colleague [Regunathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regu-radhakrishnan-4b76bb1) and I presented our work on using data science to predict four year student graduation rates at a large public university in the US, by building an institutional data lake based on Greenplum and Hadoop.

You can watch a recording of this webinar below. I could not co-present as I was traveling to meet another customer on that day.
