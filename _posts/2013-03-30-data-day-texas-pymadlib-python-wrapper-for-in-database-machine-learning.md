I presented [PyMADlib](https://github.com/pivotalsoftware/pymadlib) - Python wrapper for Apache MADlib in this session at [Data Day Texas 2013](https://datadaytexas.com/) in Austin. It was great being back in my alma-mater after over four years, to present at this event. I also had a chance to meet my advisor again.
