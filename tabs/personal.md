I was born and raised in Chennai, in southern India. After finishing my undergrad in engineering at [PSG Tech](http://www.psgtech.edu/) I worked as a software engineer in India for a couple of years in Hyderabad and Bangalore before I came to the US for graduate school in [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I have been living in the San Francisco Bay Area since I graduated from [UTCS](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/).

I love hiking, backpacking, running and mountaineering. Living in the Bay Area allows me easy access to many beautiful trails nearby and when those aren't sufficient, I typically head out to Yosemite several times a year. You can find some of my hiking and mountaineering videos on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P317FkePp7k&list=UUKCzatgStqhpXAu1lbl2QPw).

When I am not outdoors, you might find me staying on top of the news cycle reading my [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/being_bayesian) or admiring my wife [Anastasia's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasiafilina) [art and food](https://www.instagram.com/anastasiyafilina/?hl=en).
