I currently lead engineering for machine learning products in Salesforce Einstein. Previously at Salesforce, I led the Customer Intelligence data science team, solving problems in customer growth, retention and platform adoption. 

I have held various roles as a software engineer, ML engineer, data scientist and manager in my career. I led data science projects for customers in multiple industry verticals at [Pivotal](https://tanzu.vmware.com/), alongside building and expanding in-database machine learning algorithms in [Apache MADlib](https://madlib.apache.org/). I was a lead engineer in an R&D incubation team building NLP powered Android applications in XPERIA smartphones at [Sony Mobile](https://www.sony.net/) and ML products at [Sony PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/corporate/about/). I started my career in the SF Bay Area as a software engineer building the reporting and dashboarding capability in the Analytics team at Salesforce. Previously, I was a summer research intern at [IBM Almaden Research](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/) and long before all of this, I was building machine learning and data exploration algorithms for computational drug discovery at [Strandgenomics](https://strandls.com/strand-life-sciences-us/).

I graduated with a Masters in Computer Sciences from UT Austin where my thesis and research focussed on graphical models for weakly supervised sequence prediction problems in NLP. I love hiking, running, mountaineering and contributing to open source tools while tinkering with Python :-).
